title: Applications of the Python Package
---

Welcome to the Mostly Optimal Applications of the `Ergodic-Insurance-Limits` Python package, designed to help risk professionals make more informed decisions about insurance coverage limits and risk retention strategies.

## What You'll Find Here

These applications demonstrate how ergodic optimization principles can be applied to real-world insurance and risk management challenges. Each application includes:

- **Interactive analysis** using realistic data and scenarios
- **Quantitative frameworks** for evaluating insurance decisions beyond traditional risk metrics
- **Practical insights** for professionals navigating complex coverage decisions

## For Risk Professionals

Whether you're evaluating catastrophic coverage limits, optimizing risk retention strategies, or challenging conventional wisdom about "adequate" insurance levels, these applications provide a rigorous, time-average perspective on insurance decision-making.

The Python package enables you to adapt these analyses to your organization's specific risk profile and constraints.
